        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Renowned American computer scientist known for significant contributions to AI.</li>
            <li>John McCarthy was born on September 4, 1927, in Boston, Massachusetts.</li>
            <li>His early academic achievements were notable.</li>
            <li>Best known for developing Lisp, an early high-level programming language for AI.</li>
            <li>After completing his undergraduate studies in mathematics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), he pursued his Ph.D. in mathematics at Princeton University, where he conducted research in game theory.</li>
            <li>Contributions to time-sharing systems, formal logic, and AI concepts.</li>
            <li>In 1956, McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Workshop, a seminal event in the history of artificial intelligence.</li>
            <li>This workshop marked the beginning of AI as a distinct field of study and brought together leading researchers to explore the possibilities of machine intelligence.</li>
            <li>McCarthy's work in symbolic artificial intelligence, which involved manipulating symbols to represent knowledge and perform reasoning, laid the foundation for expert systems.</li>
            <li>These expert systems became widely used in fields such as medicine, finance, and engineering for decision-making tasks.</li>
            <li>McCarthy made significant contributions to formal logic, including the development of the predicate calculus and automated theorem proving.</li>
            <li>John McCarthy passed away on October 24, 2011.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>LEGACY</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pioneer in AI and programming languages.</li>
            <li>His work paved the way for AI research and symbolic computation.</li>
            <li>Profound impact on technology development.</li>
            <li>Continues to inspire researchers in the field.</li>
            <li>Received the Turing Award in 1971, the highest honor in computer science.</li>
            <li>His visionary ideas laid the foundation for the development of AI and symbolic computation.</li>
            <li>Contributions continue to shape the technology landscape.</li>
